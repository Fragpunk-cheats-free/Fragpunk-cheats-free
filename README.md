**Fragpunk Cheats** are a set of cheating tools designed for PC games, offering players various unfair advantages in competitive multiplayer games. These cheats typically include features like **aimbots**, which automatically adjust aiming for better accuracy, **wallhacks**, which allow players to see through walls and other obstacles, and **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)**, which displays important in-game data such as enemy locations, health, and items on the screen.

The primary goal of Fragpunk Cheats is to give players an edge over others, making it easier to win or gain an advantage in fast-paced, skill-based games. However, their use is widely condemned by gaming communities and developers, as it undermines fair competition and player integrity.

### Key Features:
1. **Aimbots**: Automatically aim at enemies, significantly improving shooting accuracy.
2. **Wallhacks**: View enemies and objects through walls, offering a strategic advantage.
3. **ESP**: Displays critical in-game information like health, ammo, or enemy positions.
4. **Bypassing Anti-Cheat**: These cheats often aim to bypass detection by anti-cheat systems, making them harder to detect.

### Ethical and Legal Considerations:
- **Banned Accounts**: Using cheats like Fragpunk can lead to account bans, especially in games with strict anti-cheat measures.
- **Unfair Advantage**: The use of cheats disrupts the integrity of the game, leading to a poor experience for non-cheating players.
- **Legal Risks**: In some cases, cheating in games can result in legal consequences, particularly if the cheat tool is sold or distributed illegally.

In summary, **Fragpunk Cheats** offer powerful but unethical ways to manipulate game mechanics, and while they might provide temporary advantages, they can result in significant consequences such as bans, account suspensions, or legal action.
